MANUAL SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR BETTER AUTH WITH SUPABASE
==========================================================

Since your previous setup attempt failed with:
"Could not find the function public.exec_sql(sql_query)"

Follow these steps to set up your authentication tables manually:

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard: https://app.supabase.com/
   - Go to your project: usxwudkbjngvfhtapeny

2. Navigate to the SQL Editor (in the left sidebar)

3. Create a new query and paste in the ENTIRE contents of your
   create_user_information.sql file

4. Run the SQL query to create all tables and set up RLS policies

5. After the tables are created, you can test your authentication:
   - Run: npm run test-auth

==========================================================
If you're still having issues after this, here are some troubleshooting tips:

1. Make sure all environment variables are set correctly in your .env file:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
   - BETTER_AUTH_SECRET

2. Check your Supabase RLS policies by going to:
   Database > Tables > [each table] > Policies

3. Verify your auth adapter in lib/auth.js is correctly configured

4. If you're seeing specific errors with better-auth, check their documentation
